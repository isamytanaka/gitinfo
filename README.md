## Gitinfo API

This is a simple API that allows you to get information about a GitHub user. You just need to send a request with the **username** of the user you want to know about. The API will return data such as the **number of repositories, followers, and more.** To use it, just add the username to the URL like this: `/github_user?username=octocat`. It's a fast and easy way to access GitHub user details.
